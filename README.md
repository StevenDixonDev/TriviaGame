# JavaScript Trivia Game 2.0

A small quiz game used to test your JS knowledge, now in React! 

## Libraries

- Bootsrap (upgraded to react bootstrap!)
- React

## Concepts tackled

- Observer pattern (replaced with react!)
- Timers

## What I learned

Implementing timers can be obnoxious if the reference is lost you may get multiple timers going at the same time. I also realized that I could 
apply the same code and concepts from the last project I had worked on into this game.
