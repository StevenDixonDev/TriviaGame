# JavaScript Trivia Game

A small quiz game used to test your JS knowledge.

## Libraries

- Bootsrap
- Jquery

## Concepts tackled

- Observer pattern
- Timers

## What I learned

Implementing timers can be obnoxious if the reference is lost you may get multiple timers going at the same time. I also realized that I could 
apply the same code and concepts from the last project I had worked on into this game.
